# Data Annotation Tutorial on Zooniverse #

Sloane's copy of John Ray, Historia Plantarum, includes printed texts and handwritten annotations appearing in the margins, headers, and footers.  

Plant names are the printed intended texts which are spaced from the below and above paragraph

Handwritten texts on the left/right margins are related to the closest plant name.

## Text Segments ##

In this project we are targeting the following segments:

### Headers annotations and page numbers: ###

### Footers annotations: ###

### Printed plant names with annotations in margins and the relationship between them:  ###

## Annotation Workflow 1 ##
The aim of the tasks in this workflow is to find any missing segments and to verify the captured page number. Segments are only plant names, handwritten annotations on side margins are not included in this stage. This workflow has two tasks:

### Task 1: Find Missing Segments ###
Use the drawing tool to draw a box around new segment.

### Task 2: Verify the page number ###
Once you have finished the first task, click "next" button and move to Task 2. Click on the "i" icon that appear below the image frame and a new window will pop up showing the "pageNo" field. If this number is different from the actual page number, type the correct number in the text box, otherwise, leave it empty.

Click "Done" button then "Next" button to view next image

## Annotation Workflow 2 ##

The aim of workflow 2 is to check if the plant names are linked to the correct specimens and to transcribe the side hand written annotation. Workflow 2 has two tasks:


### Task 1: ###

### Task 2: ###


## Image Sequence ##
Each page is presented with a set of 1 to 12 images. Underneath the images are several white circles, with the white circle indicating the image you are currently viewing.

The first image in the sequence highlights all segments captured for an individual page. Each other image highlights only one element that appears on the first page. (e.g. header, plant name, or a pair of plant and handwritten text on the margins)   

[![Task1.png](https://panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/project_attached_image/6a17fb3a-2e05-49ab-8ee9-c3c770e64de5.png)](https://panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/project_attached_image/6a17fb3a-2e05-49ab-8ee9-c3c770e64de5.png)

## Task 1: Finding Missing Segments ##
Please click on the first circle in the sequence to view the first image.
&nbsp;
The task in this step is to draw boxes around missing segments using the rectangle tool and transcribe their contents. If the missing segment is a plant, please type "plant" or "p".

If the missing segment is handwritten text in margins, please use the line tool to   connect this segment to the associated plant name

## Task 2: Validate and Transcribe ##

Once you have finished the first task, click next and move through the rest of the images to validate the highlighted segments and transcribe the handwritten texts.


If the text segment is highlighted correctly, please use the green line to draw a line anywhere in the image and transcribe the text that appears inside the segment. For plant name typing the word "plant" is sufficient.

[![Task2.1.png](https://panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/project_attached_image/9746baf5-3020-4048-a0d2-7214bfb3ce49.png)](https://panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/project_attached_image/9746baf5-3020-4048-a0d2-7214bfb3ce49.png)


If the bounding box of the segment is incorrect, please use the rectangle tool to draw a correct box around that segment and transcribe the handwritten text.

## Task 3: Validating Page Number ##
The final task is to validate the page number of images. Click on the "i" icon below the images frame and a new window will pop up showing the "id" filed. If this id is different from the page number, please insert the correct page number in the text box. otherwise, leave it empty.
