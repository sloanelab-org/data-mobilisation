# Data Annotation Tutorial on Zooniverse #

Sloane's copy of John Ray, Historia Plantarum, includes printed texts and handwritten annotations appearing in the margins, headers, and footers.  

Plant names are the printed intended texts which are spaced from the below and above paragraph

Handwritten texts on the left/right margins are related to the closest plant name.

## Text Segments ##

In this project we are targeting the following segments:

### Headers annotations and page numbers: ###

### Footers annotations: ###

### Printed plant names with annotations in margins and the relationship between them:  ###

## Annotation Workflow 1 ##
The aim of the tasks in this workflow is to find any missing segments and to verify the captured page number. Segments are only plant names, handwritten annotations on side margins are not included in this stage. This workflow has two tasks:

### Task 1: Find Missing Segments ###
Use the drawing tool to draw a box around new segment.

### Task 2: Verify the page number ###
Once you have finished the first task, click "next" button and move to Task 2. Click on the "i" icon that appear below the image frame and a new window will pop up showing the "pageNo" field. If this number is different from the actual page number, type the correct number in the text box, otherwise, leave it empty.

Click "Done" button then "Next" button to view next image

## Annotation Workflow 2 ##

The aim of workflow 2 is to check if the plant names are linked to the correct specimens and to transcribe the side hand written annotation. Workflow 2 has two tasks.

### Image Sequence ###
Each page is presented with a set of images. Underneath the images are several white circles, with the black circle indicating the image you are currently viewing.

The first image in the sequence highlights all segments captured for an individual page. Each other image highlights only one element that appears on the first page. (e.g. plant name, or a pair of plant and handwritten text on the margins)

### Task 1: Verify and Transcribe ###
Please click on the first circle in the sequence to view the first image.
&nbsp;
The first step in this task is to check whether the outlined segments appear in this image are correct. Based on your observation complete one of the following choices:

 * **Indicate that the outlined segment is incorrect.** <br />
 
  Select this choice if you noticed that a plant name or specimen annotations are incorrect. In this case draw a line anywhere on the image. After drawing a line a window will pop up with options, please choose the relevant one. 

![WF3Task1Actin1.png](https://panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/project_attached_image/5a186163-e948-4eeb-a16a-f0e085988f87.png)

<br />
<br />

 * **Indicate that the outlined plant name is linked to the right side annotations.** <br />

  Select this choice if the outlined plant name and handwritten annotations are both correct and linked. In this case draw a line any where on the image, a window will pop up, please trascribe the handwritten in the box. If you are uncertain about the handwrittings click on the "unclear" button

  ![WF2Task1Action2.png](https://panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/project_attached_image/d44403a0-25f2-4733-b8f0-ddb31b9b5200.png)

<br />
<br />

 * **Outline the right handwritten annotations linked to this plant name.** <br />
 
 Select this choice if the outlined plant name is correct but the side handwritten linked to this plant name is missing. In this is case draw a rectangle around the handwritten, a window will pop up, please transcribe the handwritten annotations. If you are uncertain about the handwrittings click on the "unclear" button


![WF2Task1Action3.png](https://panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/project_attached_image/39d98843-96c0-4aa2-993b-31030447d2bd.png)


Move through the rest of the images to validate the highlighted segments and transcribe the handwritten texts.

Once you have finished the first task, click "Next" button to view the next task. 

### Task 2: Add new plant name and handwritten segments ###

If you noticed that there is a missing plant name. Select the "outline a new plant name" choice to draw a rectangle around new plant name. A window will pop up, please select a number for this plant name.


<br />

<br />

If there is a side handwritten annotations linked to the new plant name you just outlined, select the second choice "Oultine handwritten annotations" and draw a rectancle around these annotaions. A window will pop up, please transcribe the handwritten annotations and select the same number you gave to the new plant name.
