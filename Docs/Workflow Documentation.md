# Mobilising Digitised Images from John Ray's *Historia Plantarum* 

## Aim ##

Mobilise data from Sloane’s copy of John Ray, Historia Plantarum, including plant names and annotations, to be absorbed into the NHM’s data system,
and then into the SloaneLab, thereby creating a digital ‘way in’ to the NHM’s historical botanical collection and a searchable tool.

## Overview ##
John Ray’s Historia Plantarum was published in three volumes between 1686 and 1704. The NHM currently holds Hans Sloane’s personal copy of this publication
which contains handwritten notations surrounding the printed text. These notes represent specimens in Sloane’s botanical collection 
(including volume and page numbers) and have been written in a variety of different hands. These notes were added over a number of years. 
In order to find a botanical specimen in Sloane’s collection today, we must physically look in this copy of Historia Plantarum. 
In other words, there is no digital version of this finding aid. Images exist of all three NHM volumes, Volume III images are currently only on MAM

## Requirements ##

*	Find printed page and volume number
*	Extract printed Ray plant name (polynomial, common name, referenced material/abbreviations)
*	Extract the hand-written annotations/description of herbarium volume and folio
*	Extract the hand-written annotations of plant names and herbarium details (found in header and footer of printed page)
*	Capturing the relationship between the printed plant names and specimens in the annotations
