# Parsing Zooniverse CSV Files

Images highlighted with relevant segments by Data Extraction service are prepared and uploaded to the Zooniverse platform for human participants to review and transcribe the specimens annotations written on side margins. Zooniverse exports the participantsâ€™ work in JSON format embedded in CSV format along with other metadata. This parser iterates through the exported CSV file and creates JSON file containing all annotations made by the reviewer.
